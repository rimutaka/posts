# What does it cost to post a job ad?
#### Competition research for StackMuncher job posting feature (April 2021)

The biggest problem with the job boards is that they are shouting to the wind. You want to reach as many qualified candidates as possible, but there is no way to pre-qualify them and the ratio of irrelevant applications can be somewhere between 70% and 90%. So the bigger the reach the more time is wasted reviewing resume's that do not meet the core job requirements.

## GitHub jobs

* https://jobs.github.com
* Jobs postings: 307
* Cost: $450 for 30 days
* Remote-friendly: yes

The site feels small and somewhat neglected. 

They used to have *available for hire* flag in user profiles, but it is not displayed anywhere in the user profile any more.

It seems that GitHub is not interested in developing this side of the business.

## StackOverflow Talent

* https://stackoverflow.com/talent/
* Remote-friendly: yes

Stack Overflow Talent has solutions that work best for companies who have long term hiring or employer branding needs. Our solutions are based on annual contracts.

For one, I am quite oblivious to their job ads sidebar. I clicked on Xero once out of curiosity.

## LinkedIn Jobs

* https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/167/job-post-prices
* Cost: $0 - $1000
* Remote-friendly: yes

It's complicated and is similar to banner advertising with pay per exposure. E.g. a remote C# full-stack developer would cost $540 and attract 23 applicants.

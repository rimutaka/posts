# His Wish

They were one of those couples that didn't have to talk. They could read each other from a look or a touch, but they talked anyway. They talked a lot.  
How they never ran out of things to talk about was a mystery. One talked, and the other one listened.  
Sometimes they stopped and kissed or maybe touched as if it was part of the listening - Hey, I hear you, I know how you feel, I am with you.

It was one of their night walks. Something was up, something was not right. What if it's our last walk? What if we never see each other again?  
She couldn't make sense of what he was saying. His words were like a stream she was swimming in against the current.

He touched her face. It felt like the first and the last touch wrapped together, a confusing mix of excitement and sadness.  
Their cheeks brushed against each other. She felt the tickling of his stubble, he felt her warmth. They kissed, softly, very-very softly. Time slowed down.  
He didn't want this moment to end. Could he dissolve into her body and cease to exist? Could he become part of her?
Then time came to a halt. His time.

He buckled and slid onto the pavement. His head hit the curb with a dull thump.  
He looked so relaxed, so happy, almost smiling, almost saying, it's OK, I'm still with you, I am now part of you.

It was a while before they could talk again.  
At first, they would talk only when she was alone. It was freaking her out. Was she going insane?  
But it was his voice, his words. It was him.

She slowly learned how to feel him, how to flow together as they did before.  
The sensations were real. She could feel the weight of his hands on her shoulders, his fingers in her hair, his lips pressed against hers.

He always wanted to see the world through her eyes. Even before, they read each other's books, shared podcasts, enjoyed the same music.  
She picked up some of his interests. They were not too bad. His physics and engineering podcasts were like white noise to her. She didn't mind.  
Jogging together was probably the best part. She was grateful for a running companion.

Sometimes she questioned her choices. Why did she pick this book? Was it her own choice or did she want to read it for him?

They talked a lot again. They laughed. He was not some ghost of the past. He was real, funny, original and full of new ideas. He was alive.

They learned how to have sex. It was mostly in her sleep. She would wake up happy and smile thinking of what they did and what they could do next time.  
She couldn't tell for sure if he had the same physical sensations as her. She knew hers were real.

He gave her plenty of space to be herself. Even when men were hitting on her he stayed silent. It wasn't his choice. She was free to let him go and be with someone else.

One thing bothered him - he couldn't give her gifts anymore. Birthdays were awkward. He wasn't even sure what his birthday meant now. Was he getting older?  
A few of them passed. They were happy, settled and content. Her friends accepted her strangeness. She mentioned a few times there was someone else in her life they will never meet and left it at that. They didn't mind.

It was her birthday again. She woke up with the pleasant sensation of his body close to hers, his warmth, the quiet sound of his breathing. She turned around and kissed his cheek.  
He looked so relaxed, so happy, almost smiling, almost saying, Happy Birthday, we are both the same age now.
